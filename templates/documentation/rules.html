                        <span style="color: #fff;">Thank you for playing on <strong>komako.pw</strong> By playing, you agree to follow the below guidelines. Doing so could
                        warrant immediate removal from our services.</span>
                        
                        <ul class="docs-text">
                            <li class="li-spacing">1. Absolutely no botting, cheating, or hacking. This includes any method of giving yourself an unfair advantage
                                over other players. Involvement with cheats in any way, shape or form will be taken action against.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">2. You may only have one account on <strong>komako.pw</strong>. Creating more accounts will lead to those
                                accounts being disabled and your first account restricted. If you for some reason need more than one account,
                                please contact us directly.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">3. Do not use any other person’s account. This is known as account sharing and is taken quite seriously. Sharing
                                your login details with any other user can result in a permanent ban.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">4. Do not try to exploit bugs found on the server, report them to a developer immediately for a fair reward.
                            </li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">5. All communications on our Discord and in-game public chats must be in English. Players are allowed to use any
                                language in other forms of communication.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">6. Treat all members of <strong>komako.pw</strong> with respect. Do not insult people without warrant & do not
                                be excessively toxic.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">7. Do not harass people. If a member asks you to stop harassing them, simply stop doing so. This rule is heavily
                                enforced, so please be nice.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">8. Absolutely no racism, sexism, transphobia, whatever. This includes slurs.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">9. Do not discuss cheating, other servers, or breaking any US or International law in any of our services. Doing
                                so will result in an immediate ban and if neccessary reported to relevant authorities.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">10. Don’t spam or flood, unless you’re occasionally sending a link to e.g. Twitch when you’re streaming
                                <strong>komako.pw</strong> when no discussion is going on.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">11. Do not impersonate any user, especially staff. This is enforced quite heavily.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">12. Do not cause unneeded drama. Use the appropriate channels to report rule breaking; Hackusating in public
                                channels is not allowed. Complaining about a user’s ban in public channels is also disallowed. Bans are to be
                                kept between <strong>komako.pw</strong> staff and the user only.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">13. <strong>komako.pw</strong> services are meant for users that are 13 years of age or older. If you are under
                                13, do not use our services without parental consent.</li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">14. Practice common sense. If a staff member asks you to do something, it is in your best interests to comply.
                            </li>
                            <li class="li-spacing">15. Use <strong>chatter</strong> or any other strange tablet filters are not allowed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <span style="color: #fff;">Don’t abuse our patience; while we try to best satisfy our users’ need,
                            if you repeatedly infringe our rules or abuse services provided by the staff
                            (e.g. appealing and name changing) (with particular regard to users who also disrespect our staff’s
                            efforts, passively or actively, or are otherwise toxic within the community),
                            we will first warn you, and if it comes to it we will offer an ultimatum.
                            If you refuse or otherwise don’t change your behaviour, we’ll have no choice but to ban you.
                            If you are found damaging the server directly - attempted attacks, chargebacks, hacking users,
                            damaging reputation etc; your entire account data will be removed with no chance of being recovered ever.
                        </span>

                            service provided by <strong>komako.pw</strong>; without any warning or reason, by staff members’ discretion. You may
